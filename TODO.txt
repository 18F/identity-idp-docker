docker to dos:

base image:
    - add an explicit base docker image containing time consuming things like ruby, openssl
    - refactor identity-base-image cookbooks so that we can cache layers easily

secrets:
    - remove or defer all ConfigLoader calls in idp configs so that we can dockerbuild without secrets
    - double check that /etc/login.gov/keys/ is empty after each layer, or even remove it entirely

- move git clone of identity-idp out of chef and into dockerfile

- figure out which recipes from role[base] should really be in the docker image


build vs run split:
    - don't run deploy/activate script at all from dockerbuild
    - don't run rake db:migrate from dockerbuild
    - build-post-config fixes
        - move robots.txt into nginx, out of identity-idp
